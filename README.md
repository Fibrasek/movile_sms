# MovileSms

Movile SMS is a gem so you can send sms through the Movile API. It's simple and easy to integrate and start sending your messages.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'movile_sms'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install movile_sms

## Usage

After installing the gem and registering with the movile API, instantiate the Sms class by passing its UserName and AuthenticationToken credentials.

```ruby
  sms =  Movile::SMS.new(username: 'Your User Name', authentication_token: 'Your Authentication Token')

```

After instantiating the Sms class by passing the authentication parameters, call the send_message method by passing the number and text parameters.

Ps: It is mandatory to pass the country and state code before the number.

```ruby
  sms.send_message('5511999999999', 'this is my message from movile_sms gem!')

```

To check the status of your message, you will need to invoke the status_message (uuid) method, passing the uuid returned in the send_message send method.

```ruby
  sms.status_message('xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx')

```

The following return must be displayed if the uuid is valid.

```json
{
  "id":"f9c100ff-aed0-4456-898c-e57d754c439c",
  "correlationId":"client-id",
  "carrierId":1,
  "carrierName":"VIVO",
  "destination":"5511900009999",
  "sentStatusCode":2,
  "sentStatus":"SENT_SUCCESS",
  "sentAt":1266660300000,
  "sentDate":"2010-02-20T10:05:00Z",
  "campaignId":"64",
  "extraInfo":"",
}
```
You can also send bulk messages with optional defalt texts.
To choose this alternative, you can use the send_bulk_message method available in gem as in the example below.

```ruby
  sms.send_bulk_message(['5511999999999', 5511888888888], 'custom message text')

```

This method has the optional text parameters to make messages with standard texts, your signature is displayed as follows.

```ruby
  def send_bulk_message(list_numbers, text = nil, default_message = 'Message Default')
    some code here...
  end

```

After send a bulk message, the following return must be displayed if the uuid is valid.
